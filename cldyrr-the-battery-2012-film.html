I recently stumbled upon Jeremy Gardner's The Battery and was surprised how long it flew under my radar. It's a mundane yet thoroughly compelling walk through a realistic survival scenario. The awkward, strained, one-sided relationship between Gardner and co-star Adam Cronheim drives this story as they wander the New England countryside amidst a zombie apocalypse.

There has been a lot of talk on this sub about lawsuits related to Dorit, Erika and Kyle not being brought up on RHOBH this season. The arguments I see are that this would make the show more entertaining. Other say that it would make the show seem more "real". I disagree with these arguments and feel that there are clear reasons why production hasn't made Dorit's issues a storyline yet and why they don't care to cover Kyle or Erika's at all. Dorit - The show isn't ignoring the Kemsley's. Bu konu da yazılır mı; ne var bunda çok kolay demeyin. Kırlent yerleştirmede ve renk seçimlerinde çok hata yapılıyor.

Like many of you I think what RDJ, Kevin Feige, great directors like the Russo’s and others have created over the last 10+ years has been incredible. Out of respect for their work and in anticipation for Avengers End Game, I thought I would join Reddit today to post my own theory to see what you guys think.

The problem with most modern zombie films is that the writers forget that the humans should be the centerpiece of the film, and not the zombies. 10 year old Angelo Puglisi, known to his family and friends as Andy, was last seen in Lawrence, Massachusetts, on August 21, 1976.

You hear a lot of people today talk about how “the world has gone crazy” or how “the times have changed”. While I can see how they would think that, as I personally feel the same way sometimes, I’m starting to believe that is far from the truth. If you look back in history you’ll see the world has always been crazy. That’s not something new. In fact, like King Solomon said, I believe nothing new ever happens.
